| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Model Correctness (30\%) <br> (Structure and Behavior) | - Model has critical errors in structure or logic. Simulation behavior is unrealistic or incorrect. | - Model structure is mostly correct but contains notable flaws. Simulation behavior is partially realistic. | - Model structure is accurate with minor errors. Simulation behavior is realistic and mostly aligns with expectations. | - Model structure is flawless and fully aligned with the problem description. Simulation behavior is realistic and insightful. |  |
| Scenario and Complexity (20\%) <br> (Appropriateness and Design) | - Scenario is overly simplistic or unclear. Complexity does not align with project requirements. | - Scenario is relevant but lacks depth or complexity. Some key aspects are missing. | - Scenario is well-designed with appropriate complexity and depth. Minor elements could be improved. | - Scenario is creative, wellconstructed, and aligns perfectly with the project objectives. Complexity adds significant value. |  |
| Analysis and Metrics (25\%) <br> (Performance and Insights) | - Metrics are missing or incorrectly calculated. Analysis lacks insight or is incorrect. | - Basic metrics are calculated, but analysis is incomplete or lacks depth. | - Metrics are calculated accurately with meaningful analysis. Minor issues in presentation or interpretation. | - Metrics are comprehensive and insightful, with clear and impactful analysis. Results are wellexplained. |  |
| Clarity of Explanation (15\%) <br> (Delivery and Organization) | - Video is disorganized, unclear, or difficult to follow. Explanations are lacking or incorrect. | - Video is somewhat organized but lacks engagement or clarity in parts. Explanations are partially accurate. | - Video is well-organized and engaging, with clear explanations and minor issues. | - Video is highly engaging, concise, and clearly conveys all aspects of the project. Explanations are thorough and precise. |  |
| Presentation Quality (10\%) <br> (Technical and Visual Aspects) | - Poor visual or technical quality (e.g., hard to follow, poor visuals). | - Presentation quality is acceptable but not engaging or polished. | - Visually appealing and technically sound presentation with minor flaws. | - Highly professional, visually engaging, and technically excellent presentation. |  |
